## Graphic Design According to UCR Guidelines

**Summary of the UCR Graphic Interface Design Standard**  
**Link:** [CI-C-11-2016 - Official Standard (PDF)](https://ci.ucr.ac.cr/sites/default/files/2022-03/CI-C-11-2016%20Publicacion%20de%20Estandar%20para%20dise%C3%B1o%20de%20interfaz%20grafica%20SI.pdf)

### General Considerations

- Keep interfaces simple, consistent, and clear.
- Use color and typography to improve visual hierarchy and readability.
- Communicate system states to the user, including errors and next steps.

### Accessibility

- The design must be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
- Avoid the exclusive use of images or plugins that are not compatible with assistive tools.
- Ensure navigation can be done using a keyboard, without the need for a mouse.

### Visual Design

Use of institutional colors (light blue, blue, and white), with a secondary palette of grays and complementary colors.

#### Primary Colors

- Light Blue 1: `#41ADE7`
- White: `#FFFFFF`
- Blue 1: `#204C6F`

#### Secondary Colors

- Light Blue 2: `#249DD8`
- Light Blue 1: `#0090D8`

- Green 1: `#95B60A`
- Green 2: `#609000`
- Yellows: `#FFDD00`, `#FFCC00`
- Oranges: `#FDB727`, `#EBA71C`, `#E46305`, `#B14212`

#### Grays

- Gray 2: `#ECECEC`
- Gray 3: `#CCCCCC`
- Gray 4: `#999999`
- Gray 5: `#666666`

**Note:** The color red should be reserved exclusively for alerts or warning icons.

**Typography:** Typography should follow institutional guidelines (Myriad Pro, Warnock Pro, and Arial as an alternative).

**Signatures:** Proper use of UCR's official and promotional signatures in designs.

### Responsive Design

- Systems must adapt to different devices and screen sizes, focusing on flexibility and usability.
- The recommended resolution is 1152x864px, with a minimum of 1024x720px.

### Basic Interface Areas

- Logout bar
- UCR banner
- Menu
- Content area
- Footer

These elements are essential and must be present in all interfaces.

### Login Screen

- All systems must have an authentication screen with clear options for password recovery and help.

### Interface Design Patterns

- Use of input controls (buttons, text fields, etc.)
- Navigation components (menus, paginators)
- Information components (icons, pop-up windows)

All these elements must follow the visual and functional standards established by the University.
