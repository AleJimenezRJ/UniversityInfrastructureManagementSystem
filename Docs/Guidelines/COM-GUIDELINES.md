# Communications

## Established Channels

### WhatsApp Community

The community **PI: IS/BD** functions as a collection
of all the WhatsApp groups relevant to this project.

There are groups for SCRUM Masters, SCRUM Ambassadors, every Cross-functional Team,
and Working Group, as well as dedicated channels for announcements
(only admins can send messages), and finally a general group with all developers.

Please keep in mind that for some groups, you **will need to request
access** in order to join them.

If you lose access to PI: IS/BD, contact an admin (any member of
the Communications Cross-functional Team) to request an
invite link.


### Discord Server

The Discord server **PI: IS/BD** functions as the main hub for
project meetings and sharing files relevant to the project.

It has a similar structure to the WhatsApp community, with the
main difference being that access to channels is restricted by
roles (this also limits a channel's visibility).

Additionally, a webhook has been implemented in the git-notifications
channel that automatically sends a message each time a pull request
is created, reviewed, or closed. You can change the notifications
received from this channel by right-clicking it and selecting a different
setting like "All messages" or "Only mentions."

To make cross-team communication easier, it is recommended
to change your server profile by adding your real name as a nickname.
[This nickname won't be visible in other servers](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409388345495-Per-Server-Profiles#:~:text=To%20access%20your%20Server%20Profile,in%20your%20mini%20profile%20card.).


### Other Guidelines


Any changes made to the project's guidelines should only be enforced if
they have been added to the documentation inside the main branch.

With this in mind, all working groups should be notified
through the WhatsApp community's general chat whenever a change
or new rule has been added.
