---

## 2. Accepted Product Backlog Items

- **PQL-LB-002-001 List Buildings:** The listing of all buildings added to the system  
- **PQL-LB-002-001 Display Specific Building Information:** Displaying information about a single building based on its identifier

---

## 3. Rejected Product Backlog Items

- **PQL-AB-001-001 Add Building:** Adding a new building to the system was rejected because the form for adding it may be frustrating for users, which would affect business value  
- **PQL-AB-001-001 Edit Building Information:** Editing a building’s information in the system was rejected because the process of adding a new building was already problematic, which affects the edit operation

---

## 4. Feedback Received

- Building coordinates should come from a selection made by the user via a window or be null to be added later  
- Validate the map  
- Standardize the interface  
- Display the building name instead of its identifier  
- List the possible colors of a building  
- When editing a building, it should be based on the name, and the user selects what they want to edit

---

## 5. Actions and Next Steps

- More frequent consultation and validation with the product owner and technical advisors  
- Improve coordination with teams that depend on our work  
- Better planning with other teams to standardize interfaces and formats
